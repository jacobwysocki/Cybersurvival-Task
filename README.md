# Cybersurvival-Task
KV6002: Team Project and Professionalism

# Client Pitch: 
Aims to digitise the process of completing the cybersurival task, as described in the paper by James Nicholson et al. (https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/soups2018/soups2018-nicholson.pdf). 

Currently the task involves manually ranking items by printing off pieces of paper, which is time consuming  and inefficient.
- Creation of a live updating group rank list that updates in real time
- Creation of an individual ranking as a starting point for the group task
- Include the record of individual rankings and group rankings (to compare quantitatively).

## Team for module KV6002:
- Jakub Wysocki
- Gabriela Piatek 
- Jack Hunter
- Rafael Ribeiro
- Olayinka Hassan
